The Safari and Opera versions are still available. But the Chrome extension is no longer available from the Google App Store.

The only changes I've made are to remove the analytics that virus scanners saw as a trojan, and updated the version number.

**Note:** Chrome will show an error in chrome://extensions/ but it still works in April 2024.
- Manifest version 2 is deprecated, and support will be removed in 2023

I'm working on updating the extension to manifest v3...
